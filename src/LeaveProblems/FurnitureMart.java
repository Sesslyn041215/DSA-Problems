//G.P Muthu furniture mart
//Muthu runs a furniture mart. Each furniture has a weight and unique id. Help him to build a program that picks bunch of furnitures with nearer or exact weight asked by his customer.
//For ex., If he has 4 furnitures with weight 30kg(id : 2), 34kg(id : 3), 50kg(id : 4), 49kg (id : 5).
//If customer asks for 100 kg, the program should return the ids [4,5].
//If the customer asks for 50kg, return [4]
//If the customer asks for 85kg, return [3,4]
//If no nearer matches found, return [-1] by which he can check manually.
