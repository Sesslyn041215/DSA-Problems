//Joe is throwing a party for his N friends. There is a cake store nearby, and he wants to buy a
//cake for his friends. Each cake has exactly K slices. Joe's friends get sad if one gets more slices
//than the other. Also, Joe gets sad if there are some cake slices left. More formally, suppose Joe
//buys P cakes, then everyone is happy if and only if there is a way to distribute Kâ‹…P slices
//between N friends.
//You need to find the minimum number of cakes Joe has to buy to share all the slices among his
//friends so that none of them gets sad. Note that Joe hates cakes and doesn't take any slices.
//Input Format
//First line of input contains T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
//Each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K, where N is the number of
//friends of Joe and K is the number of slices in a cakes
//Output Format
//For each test case, print the minimum number of cakes Joe has to buy to share among his
//friends so that none of his friends gets sad.
